# Dora's Calculator!

Nothing special 😅 Just a quick solution for some bulk calculations for a friend's daily work routine.

User enters the price of a product per kilogram and the interface shows the price of different amounts of gramms, given the price the user entered.

Basically, it's just a quick way to avoid doing divisions on a calculator all the time. 🧐
